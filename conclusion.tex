\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}


Some ideas for future work:

\begin{itemize}
\item refining current ASTRA implementation, that will allow to refine the evaluation
\item Jason extension implementing {\aser}, and compare it with the ASTRA one
\item stress {\aser} in practice 
\item think about the tools: how existing IDE and tools can be extended to provide functionalities exploiting the new features
\item investigate how the extension either improve or not the possibility to formally analyse the correctness properties
\item ...
\end{itemize}
