Dear Authors,

 =20


We are pleased to inform you that your paper # 329 with the title: AgentSpe=
ak(ER): An Extension of AgentSpeak(L) improving Encapsulation and Reasoning=
 about Goals

has been accepted as an EXTENDED ABSTRACT for publication in the proceeding=
s of the 17th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent =
Systems (AAMAS 2018).

 =20


The review process was extremely selective. Out of the 597 submissions that=
 were reviewed for the main track, the program committee selected 151 full =
papers (8 pages plus references) for oral presentation and 132 extended abs=
tracts (2 pages plus references) for poster presentation.

 =20


The reviews of your paper are included below.  In addition to the text of t=
he (possibly revised) reviews that you have already seen, the reviews inclu=
de some numerical scores (from 1 to 10), the review of the SPC member, and =
any additional reviews that were solicited during the discussion phase. Ple=
ase be aware that the numerical scores are not always indicative. As you kn=
ow, each PC and SPC member only saw a small subset of the overall submissio=
ns. In selecting the final program, the program chairs read through the det=
ailed recommendations from the area chairs, SPC, and PC and made decisions =
based on the overall set of papers.

 =20


Though there will be no further review of your paper, in some cases the acc=
eptance decision was influenced by the assumption that you would improve yo=
ur paper according to the reviewer comments, or your rebuttal.  As you prep=
are the final version of your paper, please take these issues into account =
in order to publish the best possible article.

 =20


Extended abstracts are allowed 2 pages in the proceedings plus an unlimited=
 number of pages containing *bibliographic references only*.   In a later m=
essage we will provide you with the copyright and formatting instructions s=
o that you can prepare and submit the final camera-ready version. For your =
paper to be published, at least one author must register for the conference=
 and attend to present it.  All accepted papers (both full papers and exten=
ded abstracts) will also be presented as posters.  As a result, the poster =
sessions will be a very important part of the overall program and we look f=
orward to having your poster there.

 =20


We are delighted to announce that we have funding for student travel suppor=
t. The purpose is to enable full-time students at a higher education instit=
ution to travel and participate in the conference. If one of the authors of=
 your paper is a student, please see this page for more information:=20

[http://celweb.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/aamas18/studentTravel/](http://celweb.vu=
se.vanderbilt.edu/aamas18/studentTravel/)

The deadline for applications is the 28th of February.

 =20


Note that the camera ready and early registration deadlines are over one mo=
nth later than they are during a normal year when AAMAS occurs in May so yo=
u will have ample time to revise your paper and make your travel arrangemen=
ts.   We will be in touch with you again in a couple of weeks with informat=
ion about the camera-ready submission and registration deadlines.

 =20


Congratulations again and we look forward to seeing you at AAMAS 2018 this =
coming July in Stockholm!

\- Comments to Authors :

The paper addresses an interesting and potentially important problem. It ad=
dresses 2 deficiencies in AgentSpeak(L). First, AgentSpeak(L) often leads t=
o situations where the overall plan to achieve a goal is spread across mult=
iple disparate plans that do not explicitly point to the goals that they ar=
e designed to help achieve. Second, failure handling is difficult in AgentS=
peak(L).<br /><br />The paper is largely understandable (although the Engli=
sh phrasing is awkward in a number of places).<br /><br />Overall, the prop=
osals are novel and well-motivated. On the downside, there are problems tha=
t accrue from changing AgentSpeak(L) in the manner suggested. These problem=
s are not discussed at all, which is probably the biggest negative for this=
 paper.<br /><br />Papers such as this are positioned in a difficult space,=
 where the discourse often boils down to personal preference on a certain p=
rogramming style guides the evaluation of the contribution (rather than som=
e more compelling criterion). <br /><br />Some additional concerns:<br /><b=
r />Where and how is plan failure detected? Some details would help here. T=
he current proposal assumes that an appropriate =E2=80=9Cremove goal=E2=80=
=9D event is somehow generated, but these critical details are missing.<br =
/><br />Should there be any constraints governing the relationship between =
the goal conditions of a plan and the goal conditions of plans that might b=
e invoked in the plan body of the parent plan? At first blush, it would app=
ear that these should be mutually constrained, but the paper seems to avoid=
 the question.<br /><br />A downside to explicitly encoding reactive behavi=
our is precisely that reactive behaviour will need to be explicitly encoded=
. In AgentSpeak(L), the mechanism of subgoals and sub-plans indirectly and =
implicitly achieves the ability to react.<br /><br />The suggestion that Ag=
entSpeak(L) is unable to handle g-plans and e-plans is made at various poin=
ts in the paper. This is contentious. Belief addition and removal events ca=
n also be viewed as the goal addition/removal events =E2=80=93 where the go=
al is to handle the belief added or removed.<br /><br />The first paragraph=
 of Section 4 is confusing. It isn=E2=80=99t clear why the handling of exte=
rnal events requires the invoking of an applicable plan from each intention=
 stack, when normally (in AgentSpeak(L)) one would create a new intention s=
tack for each external event. This is a significant departure, and as point=
ed out earlier, a discussion of the downside to modifying AgentSpeak(L) in =
this fashion should be included.

\- Comments to Authors :

The authors have proposed an extension to AgentSpeak(L) to enable grouping =
of related strategies and failure handling, though the latter comes &#39;fo=
r free&#39; by enforcing all e-plans to be linked to g-plans. In particular=
, the authors propose a one-to-one correspondence between e-plans and g-pla=
ns, and provide an extension to AgentSpeak to this end, as well as some pre=
liminary experimental results to show that the added overhead is feasible. =
The paper is generally well written and easy to follow.<br /><br />My main =
concern, as discussed below, is that one of the main benefits claimed by th=
e authors, that their proposal improves the overall readability of the agen=
t source code, is not convincing. Moreover, they do not (even analytically)=
 compare the advantages of their syntax/semantics with existing approaches =
such as [25,29], which also seem to offer similar advantages (e.g. declarat=
ive goals), but without the need for explicit programming. <br /><br />Spec=
ific comments follow.<br /><br />The definition of a &#39;goal condition&#3=
9; as a postcondition doesn&#39;t seem quite right, as postconditions are t=
ypically effects brought about by operations/goals (e.g. the add/delete lis=
ts of STRIPS operators). Also the description of the semantics of goal cond=
itions (page 3, second column, first para) is not clear, in particular the =
sentence &#39;However, if a goal condition is defined, having finished the =
body execution is not sufficient to deactivate the goal&#39;. What does &#3=
9;deactivate&#39; mean here, and what happens when a body finishes executio=
n but the goal condition is not met? Is the body immediately restarted? Thi=
s seems to be hinted in the Examples section (&#39;plan execution is going =
to last forever&#39;) but it is not clearly stated anywhere. This semantics=
 seems to be related to declarative goals, e.g. in [29], where a plan/goal =
is retried until its success condition is met. <br /><br />On page 2, left =
column, the +!elab_nums(N) goal has !print_nums(N-1) in its body (in the th=
ird set of plan-rules), which is probably a mistake.<br /><br />The authors=
 seem to say that if elab(N) were an action that takes a long time to compl=
ete, that it could be terminated before it finishes. It is not clear how th=
is can actually happen with actions that represent while loops, for example=
, which must loop many thousands of times before the action (function) can =
complete (return). It is also not clear whether the authors have extended A=
gentSpeak to take into account such &#39;durative&#39; actions, which the a=
uthors also somehow allow to be terminated mid-way through execution. In so=
me other BDI languages such as [29], actions are atomic and cannot be termi=
nated mid-way.<br /><br />In the Example section it is not clear what the v=
ertical bar `|&#39; is meant to be. Is it a logical OR? But since &#39;stop=
&#39; is a proposition, and &#39;.body_done&#39; is an action, this vertica=
l bar syntax is non-intuitive. Having an action to represent the fact that =
a plan-body has completed execution also seems rather &#39;hacky&#39;, comp=
ared to the plan-rules shown on page 2, left column (from standard AgentSpe=
ak). Similarly, the &#39;Single Minded Commitment&#39; for a goal requires =
explicit programming (e.g. the use of &#39;.drop_intention (...)&#39;), whe=
reas it seems to be handled more elegantly in the formalisms of [25,29], vi=
a the declarative goal construct Goal(s,P,f). While the authors do cite the=
se papers there is no comparison w.r.t. what the differences are between th=
e &#39;Single Minded Commitment&#39; approach presented by the authors and =
the approach in [25,29]. For example, Goal(s,P,f) can also drop an intentio=
n P being pursued if &#39;s&#39; or &#39;f&#39; become true. In addition, [=
25] seems to also allow failure handling for e-plans (see rules A^2_goal an=
d A^3_goal).<br /><br />When an e-plan needs to be defined inside multiple =
g-plans, it seems the e-plan needs to be repeated inside all of the g-plans=
, whereas in AgentSpeak(L) the e-plan will only need to be specified once. =
Moreover, it looks like the e-plans that are &#39;related to&#39; g-plans c=
ould be automatically computed based on the effects brought about by standa=
rd AgentSpeak(L) e-plans and the preconditions of g-plans (e.g. &#39;stop&#=
39; affects &#39;not stop&#39; in the left column of page 2), rather than a=
sking the programmer to directly/manually specify (and sometimes repeat) e-=
plans and g-plans in the structure/syntax proposed by the authors. <br /><b=
r />In Section 3.3 the authors have specified a failure goal &#39;-g&#39; *=
inside* the specification of the body of the corresponding g-plan, which is=
 contrary to how it is done in Jason (as mentioned by the authors) and also=
 counter-intuitive. It makes sense to specify, for example, goal +!g1 insid=
e the body of +!g because !g1 actually occurs inside the plan for !g. The f=
ailure handling example on page 2, second column, is also not convincing. F=
irst of all, why would a &#39;println&#39; action ever fail? If it does fai=
l, why would the println(&quot;failure&quot;) action in &#39;-!manage_stop&=
#39; succeed? Also it is not clear how/whether the AgentSpeak semantics can=
 handle such action failure. For example, some other agent programming lang=
uages represent the &#39;failure&#39; of an action as the non-applicability=
 of its precondition, or the failure of a test goal that occurs after the a=
ction (both of which occur within some plan-body).<br /><br />While the eva=
luation seems to suggest that AgentSpeak(ER) is not significantly worse tha=
n ASTRA, a more suitable evaluation would have been to see whether (manual)=
 agent-programming efficiency can actually be improved by the new syntax an=
d grouping of plans proposed by the authors. This would require some sort o=
f carefully designed user study to see whether writing agents in AgentSpeak=
(ER) is faster than writing then in AgentSpeak(L).

Summary of reviews<br />=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br=
 /><br />Thank you for your work on extending AgentSpeak (L) to better mana=
ge goal reasoning. The reviewers agree that the work is interesting. Howeve=
r, as can be seen from their reviews, they all have concerns with the work =
presented. The main criticism is around the evaluation. Although the paper =
claims this extension improves four aspects as mentioned in the introductio=
n, there is no empirical evidence that it does. This is something the autho=
rs should address to improve upon this work. The reviewers have also made o=
ther useful suggestions which I hope the authors will take onboard.

ck of plan failure handling (exception handling) for so-called &quot;e-plan=
s&quot;. This appears to be the main motivation for extending AgentSpeak(L)=
: &quot;Di cult failure handling: Failures/errors generated in the body of =
e-plan cannot be directly captured.&quot;. The explanations for the other t=
wo problems, &quot;Lack of encapsulation&quot; and &quot;Implicit vs. Expli=
cit goals&quot; would need more work. For example, it is stated: &quot;The =
problem here is that the e-plan +stop &lt;- ... is part of the strategy to =
achieve the goal !elab_nums, however it is encoded as a separate unrelated =
plan.&quot; - can you elaborate better why this is a problem?<br /><br /><b=
r />I accept the paper as a contribution to the development of AgentSpeak. =
However, why is it important to demonstrate that the new language allows be=
tter performance, when the paper actually puts forward a different argument=
, namely improved, clearer programming of BDI agents? If there is an analys=
is of results then how would you demonstrate to a reader that the presented=
 language approach is an improvement? Performance is not mentioned as a mot=
ivator in previous sections of the paper.<br /><br /><br />Other statements=
<br />&quot;Suppose that, realistically, we cannot spread/pollute plans abo=
ut the goal !elab with a stop-dependent behaviour. &quot;<br />- what does =
this mean ? Can you reformulate that?<br /><br />&quot;If for some reason d=
uring its execution an agent decides not to follow these plans anymore (e.g=
. it chooses to become disobedient), it is di cult to =E2=80=9Cdisable=E2=
=80=9D the behaviour of the above plans. Either these plans have to be chan=
ged to consider a particular state of the agent or the agent removes all th=
ese plans from its plan library.&quot;<br />- &quot;if the agent decides...=
&quot;, then we may assume that there is some functionality implemented tha=
t reacts to this &quot;reason&quot; - a plan that may &#39;disable&#39; thi=
s behaviour ? So, why is this a problem?<br /><br />&quot;The use of e-plan=
s to achieve goals is actually an important conceptual brick of the AgentSp=
eak(L) model.&quot;<br />- what is a conceptual &#39;brick&#39; ? Can you f=
ind another expression here?<br /><br /><br /><br />Questions for Rebuttal =

white-space: pre-wrap;">The paper addresses an interesting and potentially =
important problem. It addresses 2 deficiencies in AgentSpeak(L). First, Age=
ntSpeak(L) often leads to situations where the overall plan to achieve a go=
al is spread across multiple disparate plans that do not explicitly point t=
o the goals that they are designed to help achieve. Second, failure handlin=
g is difficult in AgentSpeak(L).<br /><br />The paper is largely understand=
able (although the English phrasing is awkward in a number of places).<br /=
><br />Overall, the proposals are novel and well-motivated. On the downside=
, there are problems that accrue from changing AgentSpeak(L) in the manner =
suggested. These problems are not discussed at all, which is probably the b=
iggest negative for this paper.<br /><br />Papers such as this are position=
ed in a difficult space, where the discourse often boils down to personal p=
reference on a certain programming style guides the evaluation of the contr=
ibution (rather than some more compelling criterion). <br /><br />Some addi=
tional concerns:<br /><br />Where and how is plan failure detected? Some de=
tails would help here. The current proposal assumes that an appropriate =E2=
=80=9Cremove goal=E2=80=9D event is somehow generated, but these critical d=
etails are missing.<br /><br />Should there be any constraints governing th=
e relationship between the goal conditions of a plan and the goal condition=
s of plans that might be invoked in the plan body of the parent plan? At fi=
rst blush, it would appear that these should be mutually constrained, but t=
he paper seems to avoid the question.<br /><br />A downside to explicitly e=
ncoding reactive behaviour is precisely that reactive behaviour will need t=
o be explicitly encoded. In AgentSpeak(L), the mechanism of subgoals and su=
b-plans indirectly and implicitly achieves the ability to react.<br /><br /=
>The suggestion that AgentSpeak(L) is unable to handle g-plans and e-plans =
is made at various points in the paper. This is contentious. Belief additio=
n and removal events can also be viewed as the goal addition/removal events=
 =E2=80=93 where the goal is to handle the belief added or removed.<br /><b=
r />The first paragraph of Section 4 is confusing. It isn=E2=80=99t clear w=
hy the handling of external events requires the invoking of an applicable p=
lan from each intention stack, when normally (in AgentSpeak(L)) one would c=
reate a new intention stack for each external event. This is a significant =
departure, and as pointed out earlier, a discussion of the downside to modi=
fying AgentSpeak(L) in this fashion should be included.</span></p><br><p di=

pace: pre-wrap;">The authors have proposed an extension to AgentSpeak(L) to=
 enable grouping of related strategies and failure handling, though the lat=
ter comes &#39;for free&#39; by enforcing all e-plans to be linked to g-pla=
ns. In particular, the authors propose a one-to-one correspondence between =
e-plans and g-plans, and provide an extension to AgentSpeak to this end, as=
 well as some preliminary experimental results to show that the added overh=
ead is feasible. The paper is generally well written and easy to follow.<br=
 /><br />My main concern, as discussed below, is that one of the main benef=
its claimed by the authors, that their proposal improves the overall readab=
ility of the agent source code, is not convincing. Moreover, they do not (e=
ven analytically) compare the advantages of their syntax/semantics with exi=
sting approaches such as [25,29], which also seem to offer similar advantag=
es (e.g. declarative goals), but without the need for explicit programming.=
 <br /><br />Specific comments follow.<br /><br />The definition of a &#39;=
goal condition&#39; as a postcondition doesn&#39;t seem quite right, as pos=
tconditions are typically effects brought about by operations/goals (e.g. t=
he add/delete lists of STRIPS operators). Also the description of the seman=
tics of goal conditions (page 3, second column, first para) is not clear, i=
n particular the sentence &#39;However, if a goal condition is defined, hav=
ing finished the body execution is not sufficient to deactivate the goal&#3=
9;. What does &#39;deactivate&#39; mean here, and what happens when a body =
finishes execution but the goal condition is not met? Is the body immediate=
ly restarted? This seems to be hinted in the Examples section (&#39;plan ex=
ecution is going to last forever&#39;) but it is not clearly stated anywher=
e. This semantics seems to be related to declarative goals, e.g. in [29], w=
here a plan/goal is retried until its success condition is met. <br /><br /=
>On page 2, left column, the +!elab_nums(N) goal has !print_nums(N-1) in it=
s body (in the third set of plan-rules), which is probably a mistake.<br />=
<br />The authors seem to say that if elab(N) were an action that takes a l=
ong time to complete, that it could be terminated before it finishes. It is=
 not clear how this can actually happen with actions that represent while l=
oops, for example, which must loop many thousands of times before the actio=
n (function) can complete (return). It is also not clear whether the author=
s have extended AgentSpeak to take into account such &#39;durative&#39; act=
ions, which the authors also somehow allow to be terminated mid-way through=
 execution. In some other BDI languages such as [29], actions are atomic an=
d cannot be terminated mid-way.<br /><br />In the Example section it is not=
 clear what the vertical bar `|&#39; is meant to be. Is it a logical OR? Bu=
t since &#39;stop&#39; is a proposition, and &#39;.body_done&#39; is an act=
ion, this vertical bar syntax is non-intuitive. Having an action to represe=
nt the fact that a plan-body has completed execution also seems rather &#39=
;hacky&#39;, compared to the plan-rules shown on page 2, left column (from =
standard AgentSpeak). Similarly, the &#39;Single Minded Commitment&#39; for=
 a goal requires explicit programming (e.g. the use of &#39;.drop_intention=
 (...)&#39;), whereas it seems to be handled more elegantly in the formalis=
ms of [25,29], via the declarative goal construct Goal(s,P,f). While the au=
thors do cite these papers there is no comparison w.r.t. what the differenc=
es are between the &#39;Single Minded Commitment&#39; approach presented by=
 the authors and the approach in [25,29]. For example, Goal(s,P,f) can also=
 drop an intention P being pursued if &#39;s&#39; or &#39;f&#39; become tru=
e. In addition, [25] seems to also allow failure handling for e-plans (see =
rules A^2_goal and A^3_goal).<br /><br />When an e-plan needs to be defined=
 inside multiple g-plans, it seems the e-plan needs to be repeated inside a=
ll of the g-plans, whereas in AgentSpeak(L) the e-plan will only need to be=
 specified once. Moreover, it looks like the e-plans that are &#39;related =
to&#39; g-plans could be automatically computed based on the effects brough=
t about by standard AgentSpeak(L) e-plans and the preconditions of g-plans =
(e.g. &#39;stop&#39; affects &#39;not stop&#39; in the left column of page =
2), rather than asking the programmer to directly/manually specify (and som=
etimes repeat) e-plans and g-plans in the structure/syntax proposed by the =
authors. <br /><br />In Section 3.3 the authors have specified a failure go=
al &#39;-g&#39; *inside* the specification of the body of the corresponding=
 g-plan, which is contrary to how it is done in Jason (as mentioned by the =
authors) and also counter-intuitive. It makes sense to specify, for example=
, goal +!g1 inside the body of +!g because !g1 actually occurs inside the p=
lan for !g. The failure handling example on page 2, second column, is also =
not convincing. First of all, why would a &#39;println&#39; action ever fai=
l? If it does fail, why would the println(&quot;failure&quot;) action in &#=
39;-!manage_stop&#39; succeed? Also it is not clear how/whether the AgentSp=
eak semantics can handle such action failure. For example, some other agent=
 programming languages represent the &#39;failure&#39; of an action as the =
non-applicability of its precondition, or the failure of a test goal that o=
ccurs after the action (both of which occur within some plan-body).<br /><b=
r />While the evaluation seems to suggest that AgentSpeak(ER) is not signif=
icantly worse than ASTRA, a more suitable evaluation would have been to see=
 whether (manual) agent-programming efficiency can actually be improved by =
the new syntax and grouping of plans proposed by the authors. This would re=
quire some sort of carefully designed user study to see whether writing age=
nts in AgentSpeak(ER) is faster than writing then in AgentSpeak(L).</span><=

your work on extending AgentSpeak (L) to better manage goal reasoning. The =
reviewers agree that the work is interesting. However, as can be seen from =
their reviews, they all have concerns with the work presented. The main cri=
ticism is around the evaluation. Although the paper claims this extension i=
mproves four aspects as mentioned in the introduction, there is no empirica=
l evidence that it does. This is something the authors should address to im=
prove upon this work. The reviewers have also made other useful suggestions=
 which I hope the authors will take onboard.</span></p><p dir=3D"ltr" style=
